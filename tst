When we say that `<strong>` is more accessible because it communicates importance to **assistive technologies** like screen readers, it means that the tag not only visually bolds the text, but also signals to devices designed to help people with disabilities (such as those who are visually impaired) that the text has a special significance. Here's how it works:


### **Screen Readers and Accessibility**:
- **Screen readers** are tools that read aloud the content of web pages for users who cannot see the screen.
- When a screen reader encounters a `<strong>` tag, it often adds emphasis or changes its tone (e.g., by reading the text with more intensity) to indicate that this part of the text is important.
- **Example**: If the sentence "This is very important information" is wrapped in a `<strong>` tag, the screen reader might say: 
  > "This is **very important information**," giving extra emphasis to the "very important information."

In contrast:

### **The `<b>` Tag and Accessibility**:
- The `<b>` tag, while also bolding text visually, does not carry any semantic meaning or importance.
- Screen readers typically read text inside a `<b>` tag in the same way they read normal text. Thereâ€™s no vocal or tonal emphasis to indicate that the text is important.
- **Example**: If the same sentence "This is very important information" is wrapped in a `<b>` tag, a screen reader will just read it in the same tone and manner as the rest of the text.

### Why This Matters:
1. **Accessibility**: Using tags like `<strong>` correctly helps people who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to better understand the context and significance of information. This is especially important for users who cannot see the bolded text and rely on auditory or tactile output to comprehend the content.
   
2. **Semantic Meaning**: While `<b>` only provides visual styling, `<strong>` communicates meaning. This makes the web content more inclusive and accessible for everyone, not just those who can visually perceive bold text.

### Example:

- **For sighted users**: Both `<strong>` and `<b>` look visually bold, but to someone who uses a screen reader:
   - **`<strong>`**: The screen reader emphasizes the word, indicating importance.
   - **`<b>`**: The screen reader reads the word without extra emphasis, treating it like normal text.

By using the `<strong>` tag, you ensure that users with disabilities are given the same level of importance or emphasis as sighted users, improving the accessibility of your content.
